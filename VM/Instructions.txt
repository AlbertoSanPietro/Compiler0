The file only runs on Linux, this may be fixed in the future through the prepocessor. 

The file can be compiled with cc, gcc or clang, with no particular flags.

eg:
./a.out /home/user/folder/file.obj

The test files will be added later on in respective folders, one for the standard .obj files and another for the actual compiler-generated test files
